Mekko: A Mekko chart, also known as a Marimekko chart or matrix chart, is a combination of a stacked bar chart and a 100% stacked bar chart. It is used to compare the proportion of different categories within a whole, and to show the hierarchical structure of the data. The widths of the bars represent the total value of each category, while the heights of the bars represent the proportion of each subcategory within the category.

Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is a graphical representation of data points that are plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. It is used to display the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship between height and weight in a group of people. Each data point is represented by a dot on the plot, and the dots can be connected with lines to show patterns in the data.

Line: A line chart is a graphical representation of data points that are plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. It is used to display the trend or pattern of data over time, such as the change in stock prices over a period of time. Each data point is represented by a dot on the plot, and the dots are connected by lines to show the trend in the data.

Bar: A bar chart is a graphical representation of data points that are plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. It is used to display the distribution of data, such as the number of units sold for different products. Each data point is represented by a bar on the plot, and the bars can be grouped to show the proportion of different subcategories within a category.

Column: A column chart is a graphical representation of data points that are plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. It is used to display the distribution of data, such as the number of units sold for different products. Each data point is represented by a column on the plot, and the columns can be stacked to show the proportion of different subcategories within a category.
