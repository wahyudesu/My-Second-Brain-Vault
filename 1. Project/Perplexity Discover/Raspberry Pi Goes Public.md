The Raspberry Pi IPO has elicited mixed reactions from the community. Some enthusiasts express concern that going public might shift the company's focus towards profit, potentially at the expense of its open-source ethos and affordability.[](https://www.webpronews.com/raspberry-pi-goes-public/) However, the Foundation's significant shareholding and legally binding agreements aim to ensure that the commitment to low-cost computing remains intact.[](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/raspberry-pi-is-now-a-public-company-as-its-shares-pops-after-ipo-pricing/) Despite these assurances, some worry that the trajectory of a publicly traded company could lead to a more streamlined and lean approach, potentially disfavoring the technology itself in favor of profitability.[](https://hackaday.com/2024/06/11/raspberry-pi-goes-public/)
