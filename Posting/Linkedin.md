Happy to share that I've finished "Introduction to NLP" and "Intermediate SQL" courses, as part of the "Data Analyst in SQL" track from DataCamp

I've learned When and Why databases are useful, and have learned about some of relational databases.

The courses covered many chapters, I've learned skills like:

Error handling - Debugging - Writing readable code - Selecting, Querying, Filtering, Sorting and Grouping Data

SQL is an essential language for building, maintaining and querying relational databases.


The most thing I loved in that track, that Iâ€™ve been practicing a lot of exercises on multiple data.
