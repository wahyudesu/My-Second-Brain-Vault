## Productivity is…

- ✅Your ability to take a vision in your head and manifest it in the real world, to make your ideas happen
- ✅Working efficiently, which means minimizing waste (think wasted time, effort, energy, potential, imagination, ideas, or relationships)
- ✅A system that you can rely on and that gives you the confidence to handle anything life throws at you
- ✅Having the self-awareness to pause and recognize what’s going on so you never have to force yourself to do more than your body and mind allows
- ✅Creating the clarity and focus to work on the right priorities that create the life you want
