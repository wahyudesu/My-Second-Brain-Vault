In ARIMA models, the "I" stands for "integrated," which refers to the process of differencing the time series to make it stationary

Seasonal ARIMA models, also known as SARIMA models, are used when the time series exhibits seasonality
D = In an ARIMA model we transform a time series into stationary one(series without trend or seasonality) using [[differencing]]. D refers to the number of differencing transformations required by the time series to get stationary.
