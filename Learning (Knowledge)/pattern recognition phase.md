Pattern recognition in machine learning works by identifying patterns or features in the data. Here’s a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. [**Data Collection**: The first step is to collect data that contains patterns](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide)[1](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide)[2](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition).
    
2. [**Feature Extraction**: This involves processing raw data entities into clustered patterns or features](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide)[1](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide). [The data can be anything from text and images to sounds or other definable qualities](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide)[1](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/pattern-recognition-guide).
    
3. **Model Training**: The extracted features are then used to train a model. [This is done by feeding the computer a set of training data that has already been labeled with the correct output](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition)[2](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition). [The computer then learns to identify the patterns in the data that correspond to the labels](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition)[2](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition).
    
4. [**Prediction or Classification**: Once the model has been trained, it can be used to identify patterns in new data](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition)[2](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition). [For example, a computer that has been trained to recognize faces can be used to identify faces in a crowd](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition)[2](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/pattern-recognition).
