**Discrete Dimensions**
Discrete dimensions are fields that have a finite number of values, such as customer name, product category, or order date. Discrete dimensions are typically used to categorize data and create groups. For example, you could use the customer name dimension to create a bar chart that shows the total sales for each customer.

**Continuous Dimensions**
Continuous dimensions are fields that have an infinite number of values, such as price, weight, or temperature. Continuous dimensions are typically used to measure and compare data. For example, you could use the price dimension to create a histogram that shows the distribution of product prices.

**Discrete Measures**
Discrete measures are aggregated values of discrete dimensions. For example, the count of customers is a discrete measure. Discrete measures are typically used to count or summarize data. For example, you could use the count of customers measure to create a pie chart that shows the percentage of customers from each country.

**Continuous Measures**
Continuous measures are aggregated values of continuous dimensions. For example, the average price is a continuous measure. Continuous measures are typically used to calculate and compare data. For example, you could use the average price measure to create a line chart that shows the average price of a product over time.

Here are some examples of discrete and continuous dimensions and measures in Tableau:

**Discrete Dimensions**
- Customer name
- Product category
- Order date
- Country

**Continuous Dimensions**
- Price
- Weight
- Temperature
- Age

**Discrete Measures**
- Count of customers
- Number of orders
- Number of unique products

**Continuous Measures**
- Average price
- Total sales
- Profit margin

You can convert dimensions and measures between discrete and continuous in Tableau. This can be useful for creating different types of visualizations. For example, you could convert the order date dimension to continuous to create a line chart that shows sales over time.

It is important to understand the difference between discrete and continuous dimensions and measures in order to create accurate and informative visualizations in Tableau.
